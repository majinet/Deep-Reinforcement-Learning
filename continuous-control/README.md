# Continuous Control

## Project Details

In this Reacher environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Environment Details

This project is run on Unity ML-Agents Simulator. You need to install [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) in your local machine.
